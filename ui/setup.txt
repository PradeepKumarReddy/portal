FOR UBUNTU 1- Find what application/process is using the pro, type:

sudo netstat -lpn |grep :8080
and press Enter.

You will get an output similar to this one

tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      6782/java
2- I have got the process Id, which is 6782, now this is the process that is using port 8080.

3- Kill the process, type:kill 6782

kill 6782
